tin start: 8B??- 4B number of 8B entries? - 4B number of 16B entries - 4B number of files in gfx 
            - 12B padding? - list of 8B entries - list of 16B entries - file offsets
tin end: 4B some flags?(see flag section) - 4B file size - 
            4B square side length in px? - 4B offset to file in gfx archive
